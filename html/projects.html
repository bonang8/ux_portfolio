            <h2>Engage</h2>
            <h3><small> Improving Higher Education Using IoT Devices One Lecture at a Time </small></h3>
            <p> As a lecturer at Chapman University, I gained insights into effective student engagement
                and learning retention. My research explored behavioral changes during lectures, devices
                for student learning, and teacher evaluation methods. This led to a research question:
                How can we enhance lectures by monitoring student attention with IoT devices? My Engage
                project focuses on time-stamping attention levels and incorporating student feedback.
                In my role, I created a User Empathy Map, conducted Literature Reviews, designed Initial
                Sketches, developed a System Flow Chart, crafted a Smart Environment Visualization, and
                produced a Low-Fidelity Prototype for testing and refinement.

            <p> The prototype leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), the Ru chatbot, and Reality
                Interaction Modules (RIM) to empower independent learning. My contributions include
                crafting a conceptual model, sketches, literature review and the mid-fidelity
                prototype. The Ru chatbot guides students without disclosing solutions, while RIM
                facilitates object identification and data collection. Augmented Reality (AR) tools
                have been seamlessly integrated to heighten engagement, offering visual support for
                student learning. This amalgamation of technologies is exemplified in the AR University
                Presentation, showcasing the innovative potential of this multifaceted learning approach.

            <p> Engaged in user interviews, expert evaluations, and prototyping, 
              this project is dedicated to enhancing competitiveness through an improved
              user experience. The design study integrates Jakob Nielsen's heuristics and
              competitive analysis for expert evaluations, while user evaluations involve
              card sorting and both quantitative and qualitative usability assessments.
              Collaboratively with the team, my involvement in expert evaluations extended
              to refining search features and the footer bar. The insights gathered from user
              interviews and evaluations informed the prototyping phase, leading to a comprehensive
              executive summary for actionable improvements.

    <h2>Improving Accessibility Options on Genshin Impact iOS</h2>
    <p> This report summarizes a study investigating Genshin Impact's accessibility features and their effectiveness
      as assessed by a broad range of players. The study employed surveys, interviews and usability testing.
      The usability testing was conducted on a single platform (mobile devices running the iOS operating system)
      and used a well-defined subset of the game called Commission Quests. The report provides both qualitative
      and quantitative analyses of the collected data.The report also examines potential accessibility enhancements
      such as, color blind mode, improvements to the user interface, and text scalability
