            <h3><small> Improving Higher Education Using IoT Devices One Lecture at a Time </small></h3>
            <p> Last quarter, I had the pleasure of teaching a computer science course at 
                Chapman University. Teaching brought valuable insights into the activities 
                that keep students engaged, improving their overall learning retention. 
                Researching the literature on behavioral changes during lectures as well 
                devices to aid student learning and monitor student attention span, and 
                reviewing studies on how teachers evaluate the effectiveness of their
                lectures helped me better understand classroom dynamics to support student 
                learning. It led me to the following research question: How might we assist
                professional educators to improve their lectures by monitoring students
                attention using Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices? Improving lectures by 
                time-stamping periods of high and low student attention along with student
                feedback formed the basis for my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1Y9IgPgDYnfdnHHOG8wFyehyrYcXHAH/view?usp=sharing">Engage</a> project</p>

            <h3><small> Improving Netflix's Competitiveness and User Experience  
            </small></h3>
            <p> This project is focused on improving competitiveness through creating a better user experience. 
                This design study involves conducting expert evaluations, user evaluations, and ultimately recommendations 
                to improve the the user experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Expert evaluations involved heuristic evaluation using  Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics to discover interactive
                hindrances with the user interface and competitive analysis to have a better understanding of how Netflix
                can excel and differentiate in the competitive landscape. 
            </p>
            <p> User Evaluation involved card sorting to investigate and group features and understand the userâ€™s mental model, quantitative usability, qualitative usability to gather
                insights from users by completing one-on-one interviews for moderated testing and unmoderated testing deployed on
                UserTesting.com.
